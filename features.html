            <h3>Rule based abnormality identification</h3>
            <p>The input signal is first filtered, segmented and detects the positive and negative peaks in the beat
              array. R peak locations are detected using the result of
              the Hamilton segmenter algorithm. Using the R peak locations, the other vitals
              are calculated. All the extracted features are input to the rule engine to classify
              into normal and abnormal classes using the threshold values. Rule based abnormality identification has
              achieved 97.55% ± 0.3% of Accuracy for executing the
              process for 100 times</p>

            <h3>RNN-LSTM Based Arrhythmia Classification Model</h3>
            <p>The model has a 3 layer LSTM architecture with activation softmax and it is trained and tested with
              the MITBIH Arrhythmia Database with 96265 beat samples.
              In Order to feed data into our prediction model the heart beats are extracted from the ECG reading
              based on the R peaks distribution which is identified in the previous phase. Each individual heart
              beat record is appended a fix value of data points from the next heartbeat in order to capture the
              complete QRS complex. Then each heart beat resampled to 256Hz and normalize the mV readings
              to a 0-1 range.
              The model is designed to classify abnormalities into fifteen classes recommended by ANSI/AAMI
              standard. The NN based model obtained 95.39% of a training accuracy and 97.1% of validation accuracy</p>

            <h3>Classification speed improvement using the GPU</h3>
            <p>In order to improve the classification mechanism’s speed we can utilize the GPU to perform some of the
              tasks in the classification process.
              The Pycuda programming model is used to build the GPU algorithm, where the above algorithms will be
              executed on the GPU platform. In parallel programming the GPU referred as the ‘Device’ and the CPU as the
              ‘Host’. The Feature Extraction, Arrhythmia Identification and classification model are executed parallely
              on the GPU or the device as kernels. The GPU enhancement algorithm allocates memory to the device which is
              the GPU and
              Transfers data from the host memory to the memory allocated in the GPU then the configuration of the GPU
              is executed where the invoking of the kernel function takes place. Next the data is transferred back to
              the Host memory and releases the memory allocation of the device.
